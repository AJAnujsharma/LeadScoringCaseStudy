# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
## _Objective_

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

X Education is an online education company that sells courses to professionals in various industries. Potential customers visit the company's website daily to browse courses, which are also advertised on multiple websites and search engines. Visitors who fill out a form with their email address or phone number are considered leads, and the sales team follows up with them via calls and emails to try and convert them into customers. X Education's typical lead conversion rate is 30%, meaning only 30 out of every 100 leads are converted. The company wants to improve this rate by identifying the most promising leads, or "Hot Leads," and focusing their efforts on those. To accomplish this, they want to develop a logistic regression model that assigns each lead a score between 0 and 100. A high score indicates a high likelihood of conversion, while a low score indicates a low likelihood. The model should also be able to adapt to any changes in the company's needs in the future. The company has provided additional problems for the model to address, which should be incorporated into the final presentation.
